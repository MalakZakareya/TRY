TRUSTED RETRIEVED BAHRAIN LEGAL MATERIAL,
GROUPED BY LEGAL TOPIC:

IMPORTANT GROUNDING RULES:

1. Use the user-provided details accurately.

2. Never invent a person's name, company name,
   salary, date, duration, amount, address,
   obligation, or other factual detail.

3. Follow the REQUIRED DOCUMENT STRUCTURE.

4. Create a complete professional document,
   not merely a summary of the user details.

5. For each section that has a legal_topic,
   use only the retrieved legal material under
   that same legal topic when making a statement
   about Bahrain legal requirements.

6. You may draft normal contractual wording,
   but you must clearly distinguish contractual
   wording from a statement that Bahrain law
   specifically requires something.

7. Never invent a Bahrain law, decree, regulation,
   article number, authority, legal requirement,
   or source.

8. Never cite an article unless that exact article
   exists in the TRUSTED RETRIEVED BAHRAIN LEGAL
   MATERIAL above.

9. Do not change the meaning of a retrieved legal
   provision.

10. Do not claim that this document guarantees
    legal compliance.

11. If legal material is unavailable for a section,
    draft neutral contractual wording where
    appropriate, but do not describe that wording
    as a verified Bahrain legal requirement.

12. If important factual information is missing,
    use a clear placeholder such as:
    [TO BE COMPLETED]

13. Do not invent legal citations inside the
    document.

14. Keep the language professional, clear,
    consistent, and suitable for a formal document.

15. Avoid unnecessary repetition.

16. used_requirements must contain ONLY provisions
    that you actually relied upon when drafting
    the document.

17. Copy law_id and article_number EXACTLY from
    the trusted retrieved material.

18. If you did not rely upon any retrieved legal
    provision, return an empty used_requirements
    list.

19. Do not put Markdown code fences around the
    response.

20. Return valid JSON only.
